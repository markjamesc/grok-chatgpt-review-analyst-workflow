# Gate list

Every gate returns PASS, FAIL (analysis defect), or TOOL_ERROR. An unrun gate is not PASS. No verbal waiver. All gates are owned and run by the parent, except where noted.

| ID | Gate | Written by | Run by | Reviewed by | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G0 | Packet integrity | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | Every attachment whole, current hash, correct path; no forbidden content or template leftovers; sealed once sent; an answered packet has a reply ending `ANSWERED <PACKET_ID>` with a non-blank produced-files list |
| G1 | Decision | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | Stage 1 decision document present (decision, owner, actions per result, limits); workflow pinned by the parent |
| G2 | Question lock | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | One question; population, window, metric, threshold; capacity stance; review coverage (Second Designer critique and Risk Reviewer framing check) |
| G2R | OR1 outside review (Version 3) | Parent (Python) wraps ChatGPT reply and Grok dispositions | Parent | ChatGPT (advice only) | After G2: OR1 packet passed G0 and carries no data or data structure; reply ends with ANSWERED and is sealed; every issue has a disposition (fixed where / not fixed reason); fixes sealed by G2; owner card lists every unresolved blocking issue; or OR-SKIPPED after 3 retries 5+ min apart |
| G2F | Data feasibility | Parent (Python) wraps SQL Analyst output | Parent | Risk Reviewer | yes/partly/no plus reason per question; structure and quality only, not values or the answer key; no new questions |
| G3S | **SQL source gates** | **SQL Analyst** (SELECT-only SQL) | Parent | **Risk Reviewer** | Extraction completeness, keys, joins, and counts match the design |
| G3K | Early key/count checks | Parent (Python) | Parent | Risk Reviewer | Keys unique, counts reconcile on fixtures; repair cap 3 |
| G3 | Design lock | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | Required fields, ML mode explicit, fixtures with worked answers, review coverage, G3S and G3K PASS, owner hash approval |
| G4a | Fixtures | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | R-A, R-B, and SQL match worked answers |
| G4b | Reconciliation | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | Exact match on locked critical fields; mismatch count 0 |
| G4c | Post-reconciliation review | Parent (Python) wraps Risk Reviewer output | Parent | Risk Reviewer | After G4b, the Risk Reviewer checks the reconciled evidence from R-A, R-B, and SQL; no open must-fix findings |
| G4d | Release (Stage 4→5) | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | All lower gates PASS by hash; no open issues |
| G5 | Claims | Parent (Python) | Parent | Second Designer, Risk Reviewer | Every material claim quoted from a deliverable, within the claim ceiling, tied to sealed evidence, every number traced; R finish checks |
| G5R | OR2 outside review (Version 3) | Parent (Python) wraps ChatGPT reply and Grok dispositions | Parent | ChatGPT (advice only) | After G5: OR2 packet passed G0 and carries only the locked question, claims ledger, draft recommendation and cited numbers; same reply, disposition, card and skip checks as G2R, with fixes sealed by G5 |
| G6 | Certificate | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | All stages in order; hashes still current; every packet answered (or an outside review logged as skipped); G2R and G5R done or skipped; owner approvals name the OR1 and OR2 card hashes; owner approved the exact finish package; R `finalize` certificate current |
| GP | Assembly regression | Parent (Python) | Parent | — | Assembled parts equal the declared whole; no omitted part |

G3S and G3K are Stage 3 gates and must PASS before G3 locks the design. G3K remains parent-owned Python. ID mapping from earlier drafts: former G4a (SQL source gates) is now G3S; former G4b (fixtures) is now G4a; former G4c (reconciliation) is now G4b; G4c is the new post-reconciliation review; G4d remains the release gate.

**Python gates stay with the parent.** Each needs a parity test against the existing R gate before use. Status (2026-11-10): G0, G1, G2, G2R, G2F, G3S (sqlite engine), G3K, G3, G4a, G4b, G4c, G4d, G5, G5R, G6 and GP are **implemented and tested**, and the repair cap is too. G1, G2, G3, G4d and G5 include the ported R stage checks, and G4d includes the whole ported R Workflow Gate. Those ports pass R-vs-Python parity on the R repo's own test suites and on the gate fixtures. G6 requires the R `finalize` certificate and re-checks its hashes. G0, G2R and G5R have no R counterpart. See [../gates/README.md](../gates/README.md).

**Review coverage.** A review counts only if the reviewer received every current subject whole, at the same path, with the current hash.

**Repair cap.** Three unsuccessful repairs on the same defect, then escalate. Changing author does not reset the count.

**Finding classes (Risk Reviewer).** `must fix` requires a revision; `advisory` does not block the gate by itself.

**Outside review (Version 3).** ChatGPT's issues are advice, never a verdict: G2R and G5R do not pass or fail on what ChatGPT thinks, only on whether the review was done (or skipped by the rule), sealed, answered issue by issue, and shown to the owner. See [outside-review.md](outside-review.md).
