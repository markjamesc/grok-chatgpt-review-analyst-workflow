# Persistent lessons

Lessons from benchmark runs are kept as process rules, never as case content or answers.

Format: `ID | observed failure (generic) | rule change | regression test (name or NOT YET WRITTEN)`.

Seed lessons (generic):
- L1 | Large design outputs truncated in one reply | request in parts from the start | gates/tests/test_assembly.py, GP tests
- L2 | Review counted on a stale or partial file | review coverage requires whole current files | test_g2_review_of_stale_subject, test_g3_source_gate_review_stale, test_g0_partial_input
- L3 | Counting/key errors found late | run early key/count checks at Stage 3 | G3K tests in test_stage_gates.py
- L4 | External account lockouts stalled a run | wait and retry up to 3 times, then report | none

Process lessons from the head-to-head benchmark run (2026-11-10; no case content or answers):
- L5 | Gate locked on a repaired file while the reviews covered the earlier version | send the current file for re-review before the gate | test_g2_framing_repair_needs_rereview_of_current_file
- L6 | Children wrote their files but did not reply; the parent learned of it from the owner | a send is complete only on a reply ending `ANSWERED <PACKET_ID>` with a non-blank produced-files list | test_g0_file_on_disk_is_not_a_completed_send, test_g0_reply_without_answered_marker, test_g0_blank_produced_files_list
- L7 | A leftover template note went out in a sent packet | G0 rejects `TEMPLATE` text and unfilled placeholders | test_g0_template_marker_left_in_packet, test_g0_unfilled_placeholder
- L8 | Python gates were missing from the pinned workflow, so manual stand-ins were used, including for claims and certificate | publish and pin the Python gates G0-G6; no manual stand-in for an implemented gate | gates/tests/test_finish_gates.py
- L9 | The first framing left the capacity/loss rule and the decision unit implicit; a repair round closed them | the Lead Designer states both explicitly in the first framing | none (role text)

Version 3 design lesson (2026-11-10; no case content or answers):
- L10 | Same-family reviewers can share one reading of an ambiguous term | add a different-family outside review at the question lock and the finish, answered issue by issue, unresolved blocking issues shown to the owner | gates/tests/test_outside_review.py
